// Liveness/readiness probe. Public and unauthenticated by design — the GitHub
// Actions uptime monitor (.github/workflows/uptime.yml) polls it every 5
// minutes with no credentials, and a probe that can fail on auth is a probe
// that reports the wrong thing.
//
// Deliberately leaks nothing: no env values, no connection strings, no row
// counts. Only up/down, latency, and the deploy's commit SHA (public repo).
//
// ⚠️  Which checks are fatal determines what pages the team. Redis being fatal
// means an Upstash blip returns 503, and the uptime workflow opens a GitHub
// issue. That is intended — Redis down means isRefreshTokenBlocked() fails
// closed and users get signed out — but it is a paging decision, not just a
// code change.
